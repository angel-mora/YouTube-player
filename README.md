# Notes

## CSS Best practices

- Rule for multiple elements with class atribute
- Avoid ```!important```. Using the !important rule is often considered a bad practice due to the clutter it can bring with one of CSSâ€™s core mechanisms which is specificity.
- Avoid Inline Styles. However, you can use inline CSS for HTML emails as many rules are not supported by email clients. This is an important thing if you are creating newsletter designs.
- Use CSS table of contents
- Use CSS Reset, such as MeyerWeb
- Combine elements
- Use Shorthand Properties
- Use CSS Preprocessors, such as Sass, LESS or Stylus
- Compress CSS
- Use Hex Colors
- Validate with W3C free CSS Validator

## HTML Best practices

- Define if website will be reached by XML software
- Always define the complete conventional structure
- Always set the Viewport
- Comment structure ```<!-- This is a comment -->```
- Call CSS with ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">```
- Load Javascript ```<script src="myscript.js">```
